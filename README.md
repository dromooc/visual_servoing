# DroMOOC scripts for visual servoing

This repository proposes a Python script that simulates vertical landing control of a drone based on visual information extracted from optical flow.
You can run this script within the Spyder environment or directly from a terminal with the command lines:    
   cd ~/dromooc_vm_ws/src/visual_servoing/scripts
   python Landing_OpticalFlow.py
